# Abstract
Multiscale video transformers have been explored in a wide variety of vision tasks. To date, however, the multiscale processing has been confined to the encoder or decoder alone. We present a unified multiscale encoder-decoder transformer that is focused on dense prediction tasks in videos. Multiscale representation at both encoder and decoder yields key benefits of implicit extraction of spatiotemporal features (i.e. without reliance on input optical flow) as well as temporal consistency at encoding and coarse-to-fine detection for high-level (e.g. object) semantics to guide precise localization at decoding. Moreover, we propose a transductive learning scheme through many-to-many label propagation to provide temporally consistent predictions. We showcase our Multiscale Encoder-Decoder Video Transformer (MED-VT) on Automatic Video Object Segmentation (AVOS) and actor/action segmentation, where we outperform state-of-the-art approaches on multiple benchmarks using only raw images, without using optical flow.

</p>
Detailed (MED-VT) architecture with unified multiscale encoder-decoder transformer, illustrated with application to Automatic Video Object Segmentation (AVOS). The model has four functionally distinct components. (i) Backbone feature extractor to extract per frame features at multiple scales. (ii) Multiscale transformer encoder consisting of spatiotemporal within and between scale attention with resulting features; the multihead attention transformation is used for both. (iii) Multiscale transformer decoder consisting of pixel decoding, which produces decoded features and a series of mulitscale query learning decoder blocks, that iterate across scales, each of which entail self and cross attention. The input to the blocks are the decoded features and the query resulting from the previous block; the output is a final object query. The decoder applies an affinity between the learned query and the finest scale decoded features to yield an object attention map, which is concatenated with the finest scale decoded features for final decoder output (iv) A many-to-many label propagation and a shallow (three layer) 3D-CNN module that inputs decoder features to produce temporally consistent segmentation masks. The many-to-many label propagation module uses masked attention. The mask can be defined to promote communication between data points in a wide variety of fashions (e.g within frame, between frames, many-to-one, many-to-many). We use this mechanism for temporal many-to-many propagation to encourage information sharing among different frames. Additionally, we explore theoretical connections between our label propagation approach and spectral clustering.

# Installation


## Environment Setup
The experiments were done on Ubuntu 18.04 with python 3 using anaconda environment. Here is details on how to set up the conda environment.
(If you do not have anaconda 3 installed, first do it following the set up instruction from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)) 

* Create conda environment:
 
  ```create environment
  conda create -n medvt python=3
  source ~/.bashrc
  conda activate medvt
  ```

* Install PyTorch from [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). 


* Install other requirements:

  ```setup
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
 
* Install pydensecrf (If you use CRF postprocessing)

  ```setup
  pip install git+https://github.com/lucasb-eyer/pydensecrf.git
  ```


## Datasets
For AVOS, we have used Davis 2016 and YouTube-VOS during training. In addition to Davis 2016, we also evaluated the same trained model in YouTube Objects
and MoCA datasets. For actor-action segmentation, we trained and evaluated on A2D dataset. 

Download the datasets following the corresponding paper/project page and update dataset paths in 'datasets/path_config.py'. 
Here is the list of datasets used. 

- [DAVIS16](https://davischallenge.org/davis2016/code.html)
- [MoCA](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/MoCA/)
- [Youtube-Objects](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/youtube-objects/)
- [A2D](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~jjcorso/r/a2d/) 

## Download Trained Models 
Pretrained ResNet and Swin backbones can be downloaded from their corresponding repository. For convenience to have all in one place, 
we have placed our used backbone's pretrained weights [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18FWrBdiN2o9AxvDhcsRK2HpWCbjmhWkl?usp=drive_link). Our trained MED-VT models are also shared in a [Google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yIXWhSAP-I1WwEzEHzsUkassYWj65Noz?usp=sharing). 
If you are interested in evaluating only, you can download the selected trained med-vt checkpoints from the links in the results table.   


# Training 

The models were trained and tested using a single NVIDIA Quadro P6000 24GB GPU.  

> The best checkpoint for automatic video object segmentation is selected based on Davis 2016 dataset. 
> For this reason, the results on MoCA and YouTube-Objects can be slightly different across different trainings. 
> Overall, the results in all datasets using this code are better than the ones reported in the paper. 
> If you find any bugs, which may arise while cleaning up our working codebase to create this repository, 
> please consider reporting an issue. We will do our best effort to respond as soon as possible.
